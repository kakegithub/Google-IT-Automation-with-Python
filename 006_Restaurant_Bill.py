"""In this scenario, two friends are eating dinner at a restaurant. The bill comes in the amount of 47.28 dollars. The friends decide to split the bill evenly between them, after adding 15% tip for the service. Calculate the tip, the total amount to pay, and each friend's share, then output a message saying "Each person needs to pay: " followed by the resulting number."""

bill = 47.28 # Assign "bill" variable with bill amount
tip = (bill * 15) / 100 # Multiply by stated tip rate 
total = bill + (tip/2)  # Sum the "total" of the "bill" and "tip"
share = total / 2 # Divide "total" by number of friends dining
print("Each person needs to pay " + str(share) + "$") # Enter the required string and "share"
